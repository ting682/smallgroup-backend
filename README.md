# Small group backend

This is a the backend portion of code for my smallgroup app. This backend app is built using Ruby on Rails API. This app is made for a user to submit bible study topics. A user can post the bible topic, add bible passages, and add comments to bible topics. For the backend, this contains the models for the user, topics, comments, and passages. This uses CORS to communicate to the front end. Also, the authenticity of the posts are verified with JSON web tokens. The output of the JSON uses JSON fast API to serialize the data that is fetched. For a demo of this app, [go here](https://jolly-khorana-0814fc.netlify.app). The code for the frontend of this app can be found at [my github link](https://github.com/ting682/smallgroup-frontend)  If there are comments or questions, please email me [here](mailto:tchung682@gmail.com)
